## Class Description

The Fourth IT Python Class is designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of Python programming. The class covers a wide range of topics, from basic syntax to more advanced concepts such as object-oriented programming and data manipulation. By the end of the class, students should have a solid understanding of Python and be able to build their own projects using the language.

## Getting Started

To get started with the class materials, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fourth-it-python-class.git

2. Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional): It is recommended to set up a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated. You can use tools like `virtualenv` or `conda` to create a virtual environment.

4. Install project dependencies: If any external libraries or packages are required for the class exercises or projects, they will be specified in the respective README files within the repository. Install the dependencies using `pip` or a package manager of your choice.

5. Explore the repository: Take a look at the repository structure to familiarize yourself with the organization. The class materials, code examples, and assignments will be available in their respective directories.
